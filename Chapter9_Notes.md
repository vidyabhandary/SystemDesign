# Chapter 9 - Design a notification/alerting service (Summary)

[Mindmap for designing a notification/alerting service](https://github.com/vidyabhandary/SystemDesign/blob/f13a823b4ede7784f6f578c272ffe0469d009c74/imgs/NotificationSystem.svg)

## 1. Introduction to Notification/Alerting Service Design

When designing software systems, it's common to encounter requirements for sending notifications to users across various channels. Rather than implementing this functionality repeatedly in different services, it's often beneficial to create a centralized notification service.

A well-designed notification service should be flexible enough to handle various types of notifications (e.g., transactional emails, push notifications, SMS) while also being scalable and reliable.

## 2. Defining Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Scope Definition

#scope #mvp

- Start by identifying the core use cases the service needs to support
- Define an initial set of features for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Plan for future extensibility by designing with loose coupling in mind

It's important to resist the temptation to include every possible feature from the start. Instead, focus on creating a solid foundation that can be built upon as needs evolve.

### 2.2 Uptime Monitoring Considerations

#reliability #infrastructure

A common pitfall is trying to use the notification service for monitoring the uptime of other services. This approach has several problems:

1. Shared infrastructure: If the notification service uses the same infrastructure as the services it's monitoring, it may fail simultaneously, rendering it useless for alerting.
2. Dependency cycles: Services depending on each other for uptime monitoring can create circular dependencies.

Best practice: Use a separate, independent system for uptime monitoring and alerting.

### 2.3 User Roles and Data Model

#user-roles #data-model

When designing the notification service, consider the different types of users who will interact with it:

1. Senders: Services or individuals who create and send notifications
2. Recipients: End-users who receive notifications
3. Administrators: Users who manage the notification service itself

Data model considerations:

- Limit notification size (e.g., 1MB) to prevent abuse and ensure efficient processing
- Use links for large media content instead of embedding directly
- Implement digital signatures to prevent impersonation and enhance security

### 2.4 Supported Notification Channels

#channels #multi-platform

A robust notification service should support multiple channels to reach users effectively:

| Channel                   | Description                              | Considerations                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser notifications     | Pop-up messages in web browsers          | Requires user opt-in                                     |
| Email                     | Traditional email messages               | High deliverability, but potential for spam filters      |
| SMS                       | Text messages to mobile phones           | Cost considerations, character limits                    |
| Automated phone calls     | Voice messages delivered via phone       | Higher cost, but effective for urgent notifications      |
| Mobile push notifications | Notifications sent to mobile apps        | Platform-specific (iOS, Android) implementation required |
| In-app notifications      | Custom notifications within applications | Requires integration with individual apps                |

Supporting multiple channels allows for greater flexibility in reaching users and ensures that critical notifications can be delivered through alternate means if one channel fails.

### 2.5 Notification Templates

#templates #personalization

Implementing a template system for notifications offers several advantages:

1. Consistency: Ensures a uniform look and feel across notifications
2. Personalization: Allows for easy customization of notifications for individual recipients

Key features of a template system:

- Parameterized content: Use placeholders for dynamic content (e.g., user names, order numbers)
- Multi-language support: Allow templates in different languages for internationalization
- Version control: Track changes to templates over time

### 2.6 Trigger Mechanisms

#triggers #automation

Notifications can be triggered through various mechanisms:

1. Manual triggering: Allow users to send notifications directly through a user interface
2. API-based triggering: Enable programmatic sending of notifications from other services
3. Scheduled notifications: Support recurring or time-based notifications

Implementing a flexible triggering system allows the notification service to accommodate a wide range of use cases and integration scenarios.

### 2.7 User and Group Management

#user-management #access-control

Effective management of users and groups is crucial for a scalable notification service:

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions
- Allow creation and management of recipient groups for easier targeting
- Provide mechanisms for users to opt-in and opt-out of different types of notifications

### 2.8 Notification Addressee Groups

#addressee-groups

- Allow defining reusable recipient groups
- Provide APIs to manage groups
- Implement access controls on groups
- Handle dynamic group membership

### 2.9 Unsubscribe Handling

#unsubscribe

- Include unsubscribe option in all notifications
- Implement server-side to prevent wasted processing
- Allow granular control over notification categories
- Update address groups when users unsubscribe

### 2.10 Additional Features

#notification-management

1. Deduplication: Prevent users from receiving duplicate notifications
2. Notification history: Allow users to view past notifications
3. Search and filtering: Enable users to find specific notifications easily
4. Priority levels: Allow senders to specify the importance of notifications

### 2.11 Analytics Capabilities

#analytics #insights

Incorporating analytics into the notification service can provide valuable insights:

- Track delivery rates and engagement across different channels
- Analyze patterns in notification volume and timing
- Identify most effective notification types and content

By including these analytics capabilities, the notification service can help organizations optimize their communication strategies and improve overall effectiveness.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

When designing a notification service, it's crucial to consider non-functional requirements that will ensure the system's reliability, performance, and scalability.

### 3.1 Scalability

#scalability #performance

The system should be designed to handle a high volume of notifications:

- Aim for billions of notifications daily
- Plan for petabytes of data processing

Strategies for achieving scalability:

1. Horizontal scaling: Add more servers to distribute the load
2. Asynchronous processing: Use message queues to decouple notification generation from delivery
3. Caching: Implement caching layers to reduce database load

### 3.2 Performance

#latency #responsiveness

Notifications should be delivered promptly to ensure their relevance:

- Target delivery times within seconds of triggering
- Implement prioritization to ensure critical notifications are processed first

### 3.3 High Availability

#availability #reliability

The notification service should be highly available to ensure consistent delivery with appropriate redundancy and failover mechanisms:

### 3.4 Fault Tolerance

#fault-tolerance #resilience

The system should be resilient to failures:

- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Use dead-letter queues for notifications that repeatedly fail to deliver

## 4. High-Level Architecture

A well-designed notification service architecture should be modular, scalable, and flexible. Here's an overview of the key components:

### 4.1 Frontend API Gateway

#api-gateway #entry-point

- Serves as the entry point for all requests
- Handles authentication and rate limiting
- Routes requests to appropriate backend services

### 4.2 Backend Service

#backend #orchestration

- Manages the core logic of the notification service
- Coordinates between different components
- Handles notification creation, scheduling, and tracking

### 4.3 Channel-Specific Services

#channel-services #delivery

- Separate services for each notification channel (e.g., email, SMS, push)
- Encapsulates channel-specific logic and integrations

### 4.4 Message Queues

#queues #asynchronous-processing

- Use message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ
- Decouple notification generation from delivery
- Enable asynchronous processing and improved scalability

### 4.5 Template Service

#templates #content-management

- Manages notification templates
- Handles template versioning and personalization

### 4.6 Object Store

#object-store #large-payloads

- Stores large notification payloads (e.g., images, attachments)
- Reduces data duplication in message queues

### 4.7 Logging Service

#logging #monitoring

- Centralized logging for all components
- Enables troubleshooting and auditing

## 5. Additional Considerations

#scalability #auto-scaling

- Implement auto-scaling with upper limits
- Manual review of auto-scale events
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Analytics on delivery times and engagement
- A/B testing integration
- Approval workflows for large recipient groups
